# Checkpoint System

## Checkpoint1 - Working State ✅

**Created**: September 4, 2025  
**Status**: Working development server with clean Next.js configuration  
**Code Word**: "Rollback to checkpoint1"

### What's Included
- ✅ Clean `next.config.js` (minimal configuration)
- ✅ Working React components without webpack conflicts
- ✅ Fixed Wallet Dashboard design
- ✅ All authentication pages working
- ✅ No React Refresh runtime errors
- ✅ Server running on port 3001

### How to Rollback

#### Option 1: Use the Rollback Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd checkpoints
./rollback_to_checkpoint1.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Rollback
```bash
# Remove current critical files
rm -rf app components contexts hooks lib types
rm -f next.config.js package.json tailwind.config.ts tsconfig.json

# Restore from checkpoint1
cp -r checkpoints/checkpoint1/* ./

# Clear build cache
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache

# Restart server
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### When to Use
- If webpack errors occur again
- If React Refresh conflicts happen
- If the server becomes unstable
- If you need to reset to the last known working state

### Important Notes
- This checkpoint is LOCAL only (not in git)
- It contains the exact working configuration
- Always restart the server after rollback
- The rollback script will automatically clear caches
